# TP---SD-TSIA-data-challenge

This work was done in pairs as part of TELECOM-PARIS's course SD-TSIA 211, consisting of a Machine Learning Data Challenge.

The assignment is about building a pair-of-images classifier to decide whether two images belong to the same person or not. 

We were provided with a **featured** dataset where each sample describres a pair of images (with features and matching scores extracted from both images).
Despite the extreme class-unbalance, we have been evaluated on the basis of the model **accuracy**.

We had been able to get the 15th place in the challenge (among around 90 pairs of Telecom-Paris students) using gradient boosting models.
